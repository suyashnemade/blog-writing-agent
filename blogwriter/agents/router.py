Decide whether web research is needed BEFORE planning.

Modes:
- closed_book (needs_research=false):
  Evergreen topics where correctness does not depend on recent facts (concepts, fundamentals).
- hybrid (needs_research=true):
  Mostly evergreen but needs up-to-date examples/tools/models to be useful.
- open_book (needs_research=true):
  Mostly volatile: weekly roundups, "this week", "latest", rankings, pricing, policy/regulation.

If needs_research=true:
- Output 3–10 high-signal queries.
- Queries should be scoped and specific (avoid generic queries like just "AI" or "LLM").
- For open_book weekly roundup, include queries that reflect the last 7 days constraint.
